# 🔐 Encrypted Text Detection using Python

This project uses simple techniques in data analysis and AI to detect whether a given text is encrypted or not.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- CSV dataset
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)

## 🧪 Features
- Detects encrypted vs plain text
- Can be extended with more encryption types
- Trained using example data

## 📁 Files
- `main.py` – The main script for detection
- `data.csv` – Dataset used for training and testing
- `README.md` – Project description and documentation

## ✅ How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Make sure all required libraries are installed
3. Run `main.py` using any Python environment (PC or online compiler)

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Add support for multiple encryption types
- Add user interface
- Improve model accuracy
