# 🔐 EncryptedText Detection

This project aims to automatically detect whether a given text is encrypted or not using basic statistical analysis.

## 📂 Files

- `main.py`: Python script for detecting encrypted text.
- `data.csv`: Sample data containing encrypted and non-encrypted messages.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## ⚙️ How it works

The script analyzes the character frequency and entropy of a given input. Based on predefined thresholds, it decides whether the input is likely encrypted or not.

## 🧠 Technologies

- Python 3.x
- CSV file handling
- Basic statistics & entropy

## 📊 Example
